		AutoDoc rules
		=============

		For each documentation entry that needs to be generated, Atomineer executes an appropriate
		section of the rules in this AutoDoc section (e.g. for a parameter, the <Parameters> section
		is executed). Execution stops when a match is found and a documentation result is returned.

		Full documentation can be found in the Atomineer user manual.

			<!-- Rules for auto-documentation of interfaces

				 Full documentation can be found in the Atomineer user manual.

				 Note that you can delete all the examples, and as long as this section does not
				 end with a <Set> command, Atomineer will "fall through" your custom rules and 
				 use its defaults if your rules do not supply any documentation text.

				 Additional values that can be used for filtering/documenting include:
					type			"interface" (all languages) or "annotation" (java)
			-->

			<!-- If this is derived and the special 'docPrimaryBaseWithSee' or 'docBasesWithSee' flag is set, we
				 don't use the standard documentation generation approach, but instead substitute one or many <see>
				 references. Note that you also need to disable duplication of base documentation in the preferences
				 to allow this rule to be applied for overrides.
